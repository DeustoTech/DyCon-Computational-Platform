% description: "This class is able to solve optimization problems of a function restricted to an ordinary equation.
%               This scheme is used to solve optimal control problems in which the functional derivative is calculated. 
%               <strong>OptimalControl</strong> class has methods that help us find optimal control as well as obtaining 
%               the attached problem and it's derivative form, 
%               in both Symbolic and numerical versions."
% long:  This class is able to solve optimal control problems. Optimal control refers to the problem of finding a control law
%           for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. The essential features of an optimal control problem are 
%               <ul>
%               <li> a cost functional to be minimized;</li>
%               <li> an initial/boundary value problem for a differential equation describing the motion, in order to determine the state of the system;</li>
%               <li> a control function;</li>
%               <li> eventual constraints that have to be obeyed.</li>
%               </ul>
%               The control may be freely chosen within the given constraints, while the state is uniquely determined by the differential equation and the initial conditions.
%               We have to choose the control in such a way that the cost function is minimized. This class allows treating general optimal control problems in the form
%               $$ \begin{equation*}
%                   \min_{u\in\mathcal{U}} J,
%               \end{equation*} $$
%                in which the objective functional $J$ is defined as
%                $$ \begin{equation*}
%                   J=\Psi (x(T))+\int _{0}^{T}\mathcal{L}(x(t),u(t)),dt
%               \end{equation*} $$
%               and where $x$ is the state of a dynamical system with input $u\in\mathcal{U}$, the set of admissible controls 
%               $$\begin{equation*} \dot {x}=f(x,u),\quad x(0)=x_{0},\quad
%               u(t)\in\mathcal {U},\quad t\in [0,T]. \end{equation*}$$
%               Moreover, the class permits to choose among different methods for solving the minimization problem. At the present stage, the methods available are
%                 <ul>
