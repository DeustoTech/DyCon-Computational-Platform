title: Computation of a control for a semilinear semi-discrete heat equation and analogies with a collective behavior model
description: This tutorial concerns the use of the DyCon toolbox for computing a null-control for the semilinear semi-discrete heat equation. The control will be found by means of a minimization of a functional, i.e. an Optimal Control problem. The control is computing by means of a gradient descent method. However, the functional might be not convex, therefore the control found could be only a local minima for the functional considered. Afterwards the same procedure will be applied to a dynamical system that shares the formal structure of a semilinear semi-discrete heat equation.
