<p>In recent years, the study of fractional integro-differential equations applied to physics and other areas has faced an extensive growth. In this framework, in the early 2000 Laskin started considering extensions of the classical quantum mechanics theory, based on the idea of replacing the classical Brownian trajectories in Feynman path integrals by Levy flights, which are generated by fractional Laplacians (<span class="citation"></span>). This gave birth to Fractional Quantum Mechanics (FQM), which is the theory of quantum mechanics based on the fractional Schrödinger equation (FSE), instead than on the classical integer one.</p>
<p>Later on, these kind of models found applications in several branches of physics, such as the study of condensed-matter realizations of Lévy cristals (<span class="citation"></span>), lasers implementation (<span class="citation"></span>), acoustic wave equations (<span class="citation"></span>), gravity waves (<span class="citation"></span>), geophysics (<span class="citation"></span>).</p>
<p>The prototypical example of a fractional Schrödinger equation is given by the following one-dimensional non-local partial differential equation <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{main_eq}
    {\mathcal{P}}_s u:= \left[i\partial_t + {(-d_x^{\,2})^{s}}\right]u = 0, &amp;\;\;  (x,t)\in{\mathbb{R}}\times(0,+\infty), \end{aligned}\]</span> in which <span class="math inline">\({(-d_x^{\,2})^{s}}\)</span> is the fractional Laplacian, defined for all <span class="math inline">\(s\in(0,1)\)</span> and for any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> sufficiently smooth as the following singular integral <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
{(-d_x^{\,2})^{s}f}(x):={c_{1,s}}\; P.V. \int_{{\mathbb{R}}}\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{{|x-y|^{1+2s}}}\,dy,\end{aligned}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\({c_{1,s}}\)</span> a normalization constant given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
{c_{1,s}}:= \left(\int_{{\mathbb{R}}} \frac{1-\cos(z)}{|z|^{1+2s}}\,dz\right)^{-1} = \frac{s2^{2s}\Gamma\left(s+\frac 12\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(1-s)},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is the usual Gamma function.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation"></span>, we developed a study of the propagation properties of the solutions of , based on a WKB analysis of the equation starting from a highly oscillatory initial datum in the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{in_dat}
    u(x,0) = {u_{\textrm{\small in}}}(x) e^{i\frac{\xi_0}{\varepsilon} x}:=u_0(x),\;\;\; \xi_0\in{\mathbb{R}}.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> represents the fast space and time scale introduced in the equation, as well as the typical wavelength of oscillations of the initial datum.</p>
<p>Asymptotic analysis for wave-like equations through geometric optics (also known as the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method or ray-tracing, <span class="citation"></span>) is nowadays a classical tool that has been developed in several directions. An incomplete biography on the topic includes <span class="citation"></span>. It is by now well-known that wave-type equations, in a local framework, have solutions that are localized near curves <span class="math inline">\((t,x(t))\)</span> in space-time, also called rays. These curves are, in the interior of the domain of definition of the equation, solutions of a Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations which involves the coefficients of the operator. When one of these trajectories hits the boundary of the domain it is reflected according to the classical laws of optics.</p>
<p>In the case of equation , since <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}_s=i\partial_t+{(-d_x^{\,2})^{s}}\)</span> is a pseudo-differential operator with principal symbol <span class="math inline">\(p_s(x,t,\xi,\tau) = \tau - |\xi|^{2s}\)</span>, the Hamiltonian system is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \begin{cases}
        \dot{x}(\sigma) = \partial_\xi p_s = \pm 2s|\xi(\sigma)|^{2s-1}, &amp; x(0)=x_0
        \\
        \dot{t}(\sigma) = \partial_\tau p_s = 1, &amp; t(0)=0
        \\
        \dot{\xi}(\sigma) = -\partial_x p_s = 0, &amp; \xi(0)=\xi_0
        \\
        \dot{\tau}(\sigma) = -\partial_t p_s =0, &amp; \tau(0)=|\xi_0|^{2s}.
    \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In addition, this system can be easily solved explicitly, and we obtain the following expressions for the bicharacteristics <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \begin{cases}
        x(\sigma) = x_0 \pm 2s|\xi_0|^{2s-1}\sigma
        \\
        t(\sigma) = \sigma 
        \\
        \xi(\sigma) = \xi_0
        \\
        \tau(\sigma) = |\xi_0|^{2s}.
    \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In particular, the rays of <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal{P}}_s\)</span> are given by the curves <span class="math inline">\((t,x_0\pm 2s|\xi_0|^{2s-1}t)\in(0,+\infty)\times{\mathbb{R}}\)</span>. Notice that, as one expects since the operator has constant coefficients, these rays are straight lines.</p>
<p>The approach that we use for building localized solutions is quite standard. In particular, we look for quasi-solutions to introducing the ansatz <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{ansatz}
    {u^{\,\varepsilon}}(x,t) = \varepsilon^s e^{i\left[\xi_0\varepsilon^{-1}x\,+\,|\xi_0|^{2s}\varepsilon^{-2s}t\right]}\sum_{j\geq 0}\varepsilon^{\frac{s}{2}j}a_j\left(x,\varepsilon^{\frac{3}{2}s}t\right),\end{aligned}\]</span> where the normalization constant <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^s\)</span> is chosen asking that the function <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(H^s({\mathbb{R}})\)</span>-norm of the order <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal O(1)\)</span>. The identification of the <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>-s is then carried out imposing <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
{\mathcal{P}}_s{u^{\,\varepsilon}} = O(\varepsilon^{\infty}), \end{aligned}\]</span> thus obtaining a series of PDEs in which it is possible to clearly separate the leading order terms, with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, from several remainders which will vanish as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0\)</span>. This generates a cascade system for the functions <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>, which can then be determined as the solution of certain given Partial Differential Equations. In our case, the cascade system is the following one <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{cascade_system}
    \begin{cases}
        i\partial_\tau a_0 + \mathcal{C}_{\frac s2} \mathcal{D}^{\frac{s}{2}} a_0 = 0  
        \\
        i\partial_\tau a_1 + \mathcal{C}_{\frac s2} \mathcal{D}^{\frac{s}{2}} a_1 + \mathcal{C}_{s} \mathcal{D}^{s} a_0 = 0  
        \\
        i\partial_\tau a_2 + \mathcal{C}_{\frac s2} \mathcal{D}^{\frac{s}{2}} a_2 + \mathcal{C}_{s} \mathcal{D}^{s} a_1 + \mathcal{C}_{\frac{3s}{2}} \mathcal{D}^{\frac{3s}{2}} a_0(\theta,\tau) = 0, &amp; \displaystyle x\leq\theta\leq x+\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi_0}q
        \\
        i\partial_\tau a_j + \mathcal{C}_{\frac s2}\mathcal{D}^{\frac{s}{2}}a_j + \mathcal{C}_{s} \mathcal{D}^{s}a_{j-1} +  \mathcal{C}_{\frac{3s}{2}} \mathcal{D}^{\frac{3s}{2}}a_{j-2}(\theta,\tau) + {(-d_x^{\,2})^{s}a_{j-3}}, &amp; j\geq 3
        \\
        &amp;\displaystyle x\leq\theta\leq x+\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi_0}q.  
    \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\tau:=\varepsilon^{\frac 32 s}t\)</span> and where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}^{\,\beta}\)</span> denotes the following fractional derivative of order <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{D}^{\beta} f(x):= \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\beta)}\int_{-\infty}^x \frac{f&#39;(y)}{(x-y)^{\beta}}\,dy.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, is uniquely solvable with initial conditions imposed at <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 0\)</span> and this, of course, allows to identify the expressions of the functions <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>. See <span class="citation"></span> for more details.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, a WKB approach has not yet been fully developed in a non-local setting, and our work represents a first step in this direction, providing a complete procedure for obtaining a WKB expansion of equation .</p>
<p>Our study is motivated by control problems. Indeed, it is by now well-known that geometric optics constructions for wave-like equations can be used for deriving controllability properties. These properties are usually formulated by means of an observability inequality, in which the total energy of the solutions is uniformly estimated by a partial measurement (typically, the portion of energy localized in a subset of the domain or of its boundary). In this framework, the existence of localized solutions gives sharp necessary conditions for the observability property to hold. In fact, as it was remarked by Ralston in <span class="citation"></span>, in order to observe these solutions the observation set must intersect every ray. If this were not the case, one could construct a quasi solution along a ray that would not hit the observation set and which, being negligible outside an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the ray, could not be observed. This is the so-called Geometric Control Condition (GCC), which has been proved to be almost sufficient by Bardos, Lebeau and Rauch in <span class="citation"></span>, and necessary by Burq and Gérard in <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>In the particular case under analysis, we are able to show that given a ray <span class="math inline">\((t,x(t))\)</span> it is possible to construct quasi-solutions of the fractional Schrdinger equation such that the amount of their energy outside a ball of radius <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{\frac 14}\)</span> centered at <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{\frac 14}\)</span>. In more detail, we have the following result</p>
<p>[loc_thm] Let <span class="math inline">\({u_{\textrm{\small in}}}\in L^2({\mathbb{R}})\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> be constructed employing the expansion . Then, for any <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon&gt;0\)</span> we have:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The functions <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> are approximate solutions to : <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        {{\left\|u_0(x)-{u^{\,\varepsilon}}(x,0)\right\|}_{L^2({\mathbb{R}})}} = \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}),
    \end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        {{\left\|u(x,t)-{u^{\,\varepsilon}}(x,t)\right\|}_{L^2({\mathbb{R}})}} = \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{\frac 12}).
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The initial energy of <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> remains bounded as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        {{\left\|{u^{\,\varepsilon}}(x,0)\right\|}_{H^s({\mathbb{R}})}}^2 \approx 1.
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The energy of <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> is exponentially small off the ray <span class="math inline">\((t,x(t))\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        \int_{|x-x(t)|&gt;\varepsilon^{\frac 14}} \left|{(-d_x^{\,2})^{\frac s2}{u^{\,\varepsilon}}}(x,t)\right|^2\,dx = \mathcal O(\varepsilon^{\frac 14}).
    \end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the above theorem, the meaning of the first statement is twofold: on the one hand, we have that the function <span class="math inline">\({z^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> a time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> is close, in the <span class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>-norm, to any initial datum in the form . On the other hand, the same remains true also for any other time <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;0\)</span>, and we have that the functions <span class="math inline">\({z^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> are really approximating the real solution of in a <span class="math inline">\(L^2\)</span>-setting. The second statement, instead, asserts that the initial energy of <span class="math inline">\({z^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span>, i.e. the energy at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, is essentially bounded, up to some small reminder which vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0^+\)</span>. Also in this case, as a consequence of the energy conservation property, this same fact remains true for all times <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;0\)</span>. Finally, the third statement is possibly the most important one. Indeed, according to it the amount of energy away from a given ray of size <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{\frac 14}\)</span> is of the same order <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{\frac 14}\)</span>. In other words, the energy which is not concentrated along <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is negligible with respect to the total amount and, for instance, it is possible to analyze the propagation of the solutions of simply in terms of the propagation of the rays.</p>
<p>To this end, a very important quantity for analyzing the behavior of <span class="math inline">\({u^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> is the so-called <em>group velocity</em>, which can be easily computed as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    v=\left|\frac xt\right| = 2s\varepsilon^{1-2s}|\xi_0|^{2s-1}.\end{aligned}\]</span> We then immediately see that, for <span class="math inline">\(s=1/2\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(v=1\)</span>, i.e. the velocity is constant and independent of the frequency <span class="math inline">\(\xi_0\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(s\in(0,1/2)\)</span>, instead, we have that <span class="math inline">\(1-2s&gt;0\)</span>. Hence, taking <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon&lt;1\)</span>, we easily get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
v&lt;|\xi_0|^{2s-1}.\end{aligned}\]</span> Finally, for <span class="math inline">\(s\in(1/2,1)\)</span> the situation is the opposite. We have <span class="math inline">\(1-2s&lt;0\)</span> and, for <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon&lt;1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
v&gt;|\xi_0|^{2s-1}.\end{aligned}\]</span> In view of these behaviors, we can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s&gt; 1/2\)</span>, the group velocity increases with the frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s=1/2\)</span>, the group velocity remains constant.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;1/2\)</span>, the group velocity decreases with the frequency.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the high frequency solutions are traveling faster and faster, for <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;1/2\)</span>, and slower and slower, for <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;1/2\)</span>. This behavior has then consequences from the point of view of observation properties for the solutions. In more detail,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;1/2\)</span>, the velocity of propagation of the rays allow them to be observable in any finite time <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s=1/2\)</span>, the velocity of propagation being constant, a minimum observation time <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>for <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;1/2\)</span> the high frequency rays may not reach the control region, thus implying the failing of controllability properties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This, in particular, confirms the already known results presented in <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
<p>In what follows, we present some simulations which show the propagation of solutions to the fractional Schrödinger equation [main_eq] corresponding to initial data in the form [in_dat].</p>
<p>For the numerical resolution of the equation, we employed a uniform mesh in the space variable and a FE discretization of the fractional Laplacian, obtained following the methodology presented in <span class="citation"></span>. Moreover, we used a Crank-Nicholson scheme in time, which is known to be stable for the Schrödinger equation. The initial data <span class="math inline">\(u_0\)</span> has been chosen as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    u_0(x) = e^{-\frac \gamma2 (x-x_0)^2}e^{i\frac {\xi_0}{\varepsilon} x},\end{aligned}\]</span> where the profile <span class="math inline">\(u_{\textrm{in}}(x)\)</span> is given by a Gaussian with standard deviation measured in terms of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, which is related to the mesh size <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. In particular we chose <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = h^{0.9}\)</span>. Finally, for the oscillations we considered frequencies <span class="math inline">\(\xi_0=\pi^2/16\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\xi_0=2\pi^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Figure [plot_01], we show the plots for <span class="math inline">\(\xi_0=2\pi^2\)</span> and different values of <span class="math inline">\(s\in(0,1)\)</span>. The space domain has been chosen to be the interval <span class="math inline">\((-1,1)\)</span>, while we considered a time interval of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> seconds.</p>

</div>
<p>It is seen there that, for small values of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(s=0.1\)</span>, the solution remains concentrated along rays which propagate only in the vertical direction. In other words, there is no propagation in space and, as we mentioned before, this implies that it will not be possible to control these solutions, no matter how one places the controls. For <span class="math inline">\(s=0.5\)</span>, instead, the plots show that the solutions propagate along rays which reach the boundary of the space domain in finite time and are reflected according to the laws of optics. This translate in the fact that, provided that the time is large enough, it will be possible to control these solutions, acting with a control distributed in a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> of the boundary. The case of high values of the power <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of the fractional Laplacian is the most puzzling one. For instance, for <span class="math inline">\(s=0.9\)</span> our plots seem to show a lost of concentration of the solution along the ray, while our theoretical results would suggest that this concentration is preserved. On the other hand, we believe that what the simulations are showing is not in contradiction with the theory. In our opinion, it is only a numerical effect, which has two possible interpretations.</p>
<p>First of all, for <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;1/2\)</span>, the velocity of propagation of the solutions is increasing. As a consequence, in the time framework that we are considering the waves reach the boundary and are reflected many more times than in the case <span class="math inline">\(s=1/2\)</span>. This large number of reflections is quite hard to clearly distinguish a the discrete level, even when working with very fine meshes (for our simulations, for instance, we are considering a mesh of <span class="math inline">\(500\)</span> points, corresponding to a step <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> of the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3}\)</span>).</p>
<p>A second possible interpretation is that this strange phenomenon appearing in the plot can be explained with the accumulation of higher order terms in the asymptotic expansion of <span class="math inline">\({z^{\,\varepsilon}}\)</span> which, combined with the small size of the space interval considered, enhance a chaotic behavior. This interpretation is supported by the fact that, as it is shown in Figure [plot_03], enlarging the space domain up to <span class="math inline">\((-6,6)\)</span> it is possible to appreciate again the localization of the solution along the rays.</p>
<p>In Figure [plot_02], the simulations have been run with an initial datum with frequency <span class="math inline">\(\xi_0=\pi^2/16\)</span>. The plots obtained show a behavior which is totally analogous with what observed in Figure [plot_01]:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s=0.1\)</span>, the solutions are once again concentrated along vertical rays, without propagation in time and, therefore, without possibility of being controlled.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s=0.5\)</span>, we have propagation with constant velocity, and the ray reaches the boundary in finite time.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(s=0.9\)</span> the chaotic comportment is still present.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Once again, the most surprising case is the last one, for <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;0.5\)</span>, in which the simulations seem to display dispersive features. Nevertheless, as we mentioned before, we retain that this does not contradict the theoretical results, and we think that this chaotic behavior is purely a numerical effect generated by the small size of the space interval <span class="math inline">\((-1,1)\)</span>, by the high velocity of propagation of the solutions, and by the accumulation of high order terms in the asymptotic expansion. In fact, we can observe that the enlargement of the space domain up to <span class="math inline">\((-6,6)\)</span> seems to fix the problem, and the localization of the solution along the rays appears once again (see Figure [plot_03]). This, in our opinion, justifies our interpretation of the phenomenon.</p>
